Dropout, Batch Norm, and 2D convolutions are some of the workhorses of deep learning in computer vision. You've also worked hard to make your code efficient and vectorized.\n\nFor the last part of this assignment, though, we're going to leave behind your beautiful codebase and instead migrate to one of two popular deep learning frameworks: in this instance, PyTorch (or TensorFlow, if you switch over to that notebook). \n\n### What is PyTorch?\n\nPyTorch is a system for executing dynamic computational graphs over Tensor objects that behave similarly as numpy ndarray. It comes with a powerful automatic differentiation engine that removes the need for manual back-propagation. \n\n### Why?\n\n* Our code will now run on GPUs! Much faster training. When using a framework like PyTorch or TensorFlow you can harness the power of the GPU for your own custom neural network architectures without having to write CUDA code directly (which is beyond the scope of this class).\n* We want you to be ready to use one of these frameworks for your project so you can experiment more efficiently than if you were writing every feature you want to use by hand. \n* We want you to stand on the shoulders of giants! TensorFlow and PyTorch are both excellent frameworks that will make your lives a lot easier, and now that you understand their guts, you are free to use them :) \n* We want you to be exposed to the sort of deep learning code you might run into in academia or industry.\n\n### PyTorch versions\nThis notebook assumes that you are using **PyTorch version 0.4**. Prior to this version, Tensors had to be wrapped in Variable objects to be used in autograd; however Variables have now been deprecated. In addition 0.4 also separates a Tensor's datatype from its device, and uses numpy-style factories for constructing Tensors rather than directly invoking Tensor constructors."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## How will I learn PyTorch?\n\nJustin Johnson has made an excellent [tutorial](https://github.com/jcjohnson/pytorch-examples) for PyTorch. \n\nYou can also find the detailed [API doc](http://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) here. If you have other questions that are not addressed by the API docs, the [PyTorch forum](https://discuss.pytorch.org/) is a much better place to ask than StackOverflow.\n\n\n# Table of Contents\n\nThis assignment has 5 parts.

After this exercise, you will come to appreciate the high-level model API more.\n\nWe will start with a simple fully-connected ReLU network with two hidden layers and no biases for CIFAR classification. \nThis implementation computes the forward pass using operations on PyTorch Tensors, and uses PyTorch autograd to compute gradients. It is important that you understand every line, because you will write a harder version after the example.\n\nWhen we create a PyTorch Tensor with `requires_grad=True`, then operations involving that Tensor will not just compute values; they will also build up a computational graph in the background, allowing us to easily backpropagate through the graph to compute gradients of some Tensors with respect to a downstream loss.

As a simple example, we provide a `flatten` function below which reshapes image data for use in a fully-connected neural network.\n\nRecall that image data is typically stored in a Tensor of shape N x C x H x W, where:\n\n* N is the number of datapoints\n* C is the number of channels\n* H is the height of the intermediate feature map in pixels\n* W is the height of the intermediate feature map in pixels\n\nThis is the right way to represent the data when we are doing something like a 2D convolution, that needs spatial understanding of where the intermediate features are relative to each other. When we use fully connected affine layers to process the image, however, we want each datapoint to be represented by a single vector -- it's no longer useful to segregate the different channels, rows, and columns of the data. So, we use a \"flatten\" operation to collapse the `C x H x W` values per representation into a single long vector. The flatten function below first reads in the N, C, H, and W values from a given batch of data, and then returns a \"view\" of that data. \"View\" is analogous to numpy's \"reshape\" method: it reshapes x's dimensions to be N x ??, where ?? is allowed to be anything (in this case, it will be C x H x W, but we don't need to specify that explicitly).

PyTorch Module API\n\nBarebone PyTorch requires that we track all the parameter tensors by hand. This is fine for small networks with a few tensors, but it would be extremely inconvenient and error-prone to track tens or hundreds of tensors in larger networks.\n\nPyTorch provides the `nn.Module` API for you to define arbitrary network architectures, while tracking every learnable parameters for you. In Part II, we implemented SGD ourselves. PyTorch also provides the `torch.optim` package that implements all the common optimizers, such as RMSProp, Adagrad, and Adam. It even supports approximate second-order methods like L-BFGS! You can refer to the [doc](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html) for the exact specifications of each optimizer.\n\nTo use the Module API, follow the steps below:\n\n1. Subclass `nn.Module`. Give your network class an intuitive name like `TwoLayerFC`. \n\n2. In the constructor `__init__()`, define all the layers you need as class attributes. Layer objects like `nn.Linear` and `nn.Conv2d` are themselves `nn.Module` subclasses and contain learnable parameters, so that you don't have to instantiate the raw tensors yourself. `nn.Module` will track these internal parameters for you. Refer to the [doc](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html) to learn more about the dozens of builtin layers. **Warning**: don't forget to call the `super().__init__()` first!\n\n3. In the `forward()` method, define the *connectivity* of your network. You should use the attributes defined in `__init__` as function calls that take tensor as input and output the \"transformed\" tensor. Do *not* create any new layers with learnable parameters in `forward()`! All of them must be declared upfront in `__init__`. \n\nAfter you define your Module subclass, you can instantiate it as an object and call it just like the NN forward function in part II.\n\n### Module API: Two-Layer Network\nHere is a concrete example of a 2-layer fully connected network:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"class TwoLayerFC(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_classes):\n        super().__init__()\n        # assign layer objects to class attributes\n        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)\n        # nn.init package contains convenient initialization methods\n        # http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#torch-nn-init \n        nn.init.kaiming_normal_(self.fc1.weight)\n        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_classes)\n        nn.init.kaiming_normal_(self.fc2.weight)\n    \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # forward always defines connectivity\n        x = flatten(x)\n        scores = self.fc2(F.relu(self.fc1(x)))\n        return scores\n\ndef test_TwoLayerFC():\n    input_size = 50\n    x = torch.zeros((64, input_size), dtype=dtype)  # minibatch size 64, feature dimension 50\n    model = TwoLayerFC(input_size, 42, 10)\n    scores = model(x)\n    print(scores.size())  # you should see [64, 10]\ntest_TwoLayerFC()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Module API: Three-Layer ConvNet\nIt's your turn to implement a 3-layer ConvNet followed by a fully connected layer.

Do more or fewer do better?\n- **Pooling vs Strided Convolution**: Do you use max pooling or just stride convolutions?\n- **Batch normalization**: Try adding spatial batch normalization after convolution layers and vanilla batch normalization after affine layers. Do your networks train faster?\n- **Network architecture**: The network above has two layers of trainable parameters. Can you do better with a deep network? Good architectures to try include:\n    - [conv-relu-pool]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]\n    - [conv-relu-conv-relu-pool]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]\n    - [batchnorm-relu-conv]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]\n- **Global Average Pooling**: Instead of flattening and then having multiple affine layers, perform convolutions until your image gets small (7x7 or so) and then perform an average pooling operation to get to a 1x1 image picture (1, 1 , Filter#), which is then reshaped into a (Filter#) vector. This is used in [Google's Inception Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567) (See Table 1 for their architecture).\n- **Regularization**: Add l2 weight regularization, or perhaps use Dropout.\n\n### Tips for training\nFor each network architecture that you try, you should tune the learning rate and other hyperparameters. When doing this there are a couple important things to keep in mind:\n\n- If the parameters are working well, you should see improvement within a few hundred iterations\n- Remember the coarse-to-fine approach for hyperparameter tuning: start by testing a large range of hyperparameters for just a few training iterations to find the combinations of parameters that are working at all.\n- Once you have found some sets of parameters that seem to work, search more finely around these parameters. You may need to train for more epochs.\n- You should use the validation set for hyperparameter search, and save your test set for evaluating your architecture on the best parameters as selected by the validation set.\n\n### Going above and beyond\nIf you are feeling adventurous there are many other features you can implement to try and improve your performance. You are **not required** to implement any of these, but don't miss the fun if you have time!\n\n- Alternative optimizers: you can try Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop, etc.\n- Alternative activation functions such as leaky ReLU, parametric ReLU, ELU, or MaxOut.\n- Model ensembles\n- Data augmentation\n- New Architectures\n  - [ResNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) where the input from the previous layer is added to the output.\n  - [DenseNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) where inputs into previous layers are concatenated together.\n  - [This blog has an in-depth overview](https://chatbotslife.com/resnets-highwaynets-and-densenets-oh-my-9bb15918ee32)\n\n### Have fun and happy training!
